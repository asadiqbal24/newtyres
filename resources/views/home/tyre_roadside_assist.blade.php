            <p class="sc-dnqmqq btZTLD">Tyre roadside assistance is used if you receive a tyre puncture while you are driving. This is not a mechanical car breakdown service, it is used only for tyre emergencies.
                <br>Even if you purchased the problematic tyre elsewhere, you can call the roadside assistance number and someone from the NRMA (or their associated company) will come out to you.
                <br>On your membership you are allowed to make unlimited calls for assistance.</p>

                <br>Once we have received that information from you, we will send your details to the NRMA who will create your membership account.
                <br>We will email you when your membership is setup - this can take between 4-6 weeks.
                <br>The offer for Free Tyre Roadside Assistance expires within 30 days after purchase of your tyres. If we do not receive your registration details within 30 days of our registration request, we will assume you do not want the tyre roadside assistance, and requests after this time period will be invalid.</p>
